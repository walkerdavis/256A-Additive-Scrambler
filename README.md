# 256A-Additive-Scrambler
## Walker Davis
### Instructors: Romain Michon and Tim O'Brien

### *Disclaimer:* This is my very first coding project ever!!!  Please don't hold me accountable for any of the code here.  That being said, I think the core idea of a randomly generated additive synth is nice and could possibly be recycled into a future project/product.  Please check out the demo and beat [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9ZgSN4wX9A).

## Controls
* frequency slider specifies frequency of "fundamental," or lowest frequency
* gain slider specifies relative gain
* on/off button randomizes the frequencies of all sine waves excluding the "fundamental"


## Potential Improvements/things I do not know how to do
* smooth out frequencySlider
* add notched slider or number box to specify number of voices
* adjust slope of amplitudes of upper partials
